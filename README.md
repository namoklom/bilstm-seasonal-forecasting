# üìà Forecasting Seasonal Time Series Data Using Bidirectional LSTM Networks

---

## üåü Project Overview

This project is focused on developing and evaluating a **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)** deep learning model for forecasting **seasonal time series data**. Seasonal time series, commonly encountered in fields like meteorology, retail sales, energy consumption, and economics, exhibit repeated patterns over fixed intervals‚Äîsuch as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly cycles.

Forecasting such data accurately is crucial for planning and decision making. Traditional methods like ARIMA or Holt-Winters exponential smoothing can work well but often struggle to capture complex nonlinear relationships and long-term dependencies. Deep learning, especially Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTM architectures, offer powerful tools to model these sequences because they can learn temporal dependencies effectively.

This project uses TensorFlow to:

- Generate synthetic seasonal time series data combining trend, seasonality, and noise components  
- Prepare the data with sliding windows appropriate for sequence models  
- Build a Bidirectional LSTM model that learns from both past and future context within sequences  
- Train the model with dynamic learning rate adjustment for efficient optimization  
- Evaluate forecasting accuracy with meaningful metrics  
- Visualize both training dynamics and final forecasting performance

## üéØ Why Forecast Seasonal Time Series with BiLSTM?

### Challenges in Seasonal Time Series Forecasting

Seasonal time series data often contains:

- **Trend:** A long-term increase or decrease in values  
- **Seasonality:** Regular periodic fluctuations (daily, weekly, yearly)  
- **Noise:** Random fluctuations due to unpredictable factors  

Accurate forecasting requires modeling these components simultaneously while capturing intricate temporal dependencies.

### Traditional vs Deep Learning Approaches

- **Traditional statistical models** (e.g., ARIMA, Holt-Winters) assume linear relationships and require manual feature engineering to capture seasonality and trend, which limits flexibility.  
- **Deep learning models**, particularly **LSTM networks**, inherently model long-range dependencies and nonlinearities by maintaining memory states across sequences.  
- **Bidirectional LSTMs** take this further by processing sequences in both forward and backward directions, enabling the model to have richer context when predicting values at each timestep.  

Hence, BiLSTM is well-suited for seasonal data where the value at a time point depends not only on past but also future data patterns within a window.

## üß© Synthetic Data Generation

To develop and test the model, synthetic time series data was generated to simulate realistic seasonal patterns with noise and trend.

### Components

- **Trend:** A linear upward or downward slope added over time to mimic gradual changes.  
- **Seasonality:** A periodic repeating pattern using sine/cosine functions or piecewise patterns with a fixed period (e.g., 365 days for yearly seasonality).  
- **Noise:** Random Gaussian noise to simulate measurement errors or random external influences.  

### Implementation Details

The following helper functions were implemented:

- `trend(time, slope)`: Returns a linear trend component given a slope.  
- `seasonality(time, period, amplitude)`: Generates a repeating seasonal pattern based on the time vector, period length, and amplitude.  
- `noise(time, noise_level, seed)`: Adds Gaussian noise with specified noise level and random seed for reproducibility.  

Example code snippet for generating a 4-year daily time series:

```python
time = np.arange(4 * 365 + 1, dtype="float32")  # 4 years of daily data
series = trend(time, slope=0.005) + 10
series += seasonality(time, period=365, amplitude=50)
series += noise(time, noise_level=3, seed=51)
```
